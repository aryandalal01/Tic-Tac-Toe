# Tic-Tac-Toe
Interactive Tic Tac Toe Game
An interactive Tic Tac Toe game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on delivering an engaging and accessible user experience. The game features a clean, intuitive interface that allows players to easily navigate and enjoy classic gameplay.

JavaScript was employed to manage the gameâ€™s logic, providing real-time interaction between players, immediate visual feedback on moves, and automatic detection of win conditions or ties. CSS was utilized to create a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring that the game is playable across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

This project demonstrates proficiency in integrating front-end technologies to build interactive web applications that are both functional and visually appealing.
